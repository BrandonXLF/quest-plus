# Quest+

**Quest+** is a Chrome extension that enhances the University of Waterloo's Quest platform with a persistent schedule visualization and links to instructor and course reviews. 

## Features

### Schedule Visualization
* Persistent and time-accurate visualization of your course schedule
* Added to all pages (my schedule, shopping card, and class modification pages)

### Links to Reviews
* UW Flow and Rate My Professors links are added next to instructor's names
* Courses names are linked to their page on UW Flow

## Building
Quest+ is built using Node.js, so make sure it is installed and set up properly. With Node.js installed, run `npm install` to install dependencies and run `npm run build` to build release versions of the code. Run `npm run watch` to automatically build when files are changed.
